# Oneday experience contracts

`npm run verify` is the only merge/deploy gate. A green unit suite alone is
not a releasable result: the command also runs the rendered timeline, agent,
API, drawing, grid and mounted-component contracts before producing `main.js`.

## Contract layers

- `src/**/*.test.ts`: pure data, ownership, lifecycle and source-write rules.
- `e2e/draw-smoke.mjs`: timeline gestures and focus/edit contracts.
- `e2e/grid-smoke.mjs`: fixed chrome, hit targets and component geometry.
- `e2e/mount-smoke.mjs`: shared design tokens, nested scrolling, text-save and
  responsive mounted-component contracts.
- Real Obsidian review: CodeMirror/MarkdownPostProcessor, multi-pane ownership,
  plugin reload and theme cascade. This remains a required local release step
  until Obsidian provides a distributable CI runtime.

## Rules for regressions

1. Name the user-visible invariant before editing production code.
2. Add a test that fails for the reported behavior.
3. Fix the owning state/layer/lifecycle rule, not the screenshot symptom.
4. Run the affected contract while iterating, then freeze the candidate and run
   `npm run verify` once.
5. For visual behavior, assert relationships (same height/token/inset and
   correct z-order/hit target) and inspect the generated light/dark screenshots.

The CI workflow runs the same command on every push and pull request. It does
not claim to emulate the proprietary Obsidian desktop lifecycle; production
smoke findings must therefore be turned into the closest deterministic contract
and recorded here when a true application-level harness becomes available.
